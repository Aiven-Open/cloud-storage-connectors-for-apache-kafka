/**
 * An {@link DistributionStrategy} provides a mechanism to share the work of processing records from objects (or files)
 * into tasks, which are subsequently processed (potentially in parallel) by Kafka Connect workers.
 * <p>
 * The number of objects in cloud storage can be very high, and they are distributed amongst tasks to minimize the
 * overhead of assigning work to Kafka worker threads. All objects assigned to the same task will be processed together
 * sequentially by the same worker, which can be useful for maintaining order between objects. There are usually fewer
 * workers than tasks, and they will be assigned the remaining tasks as work completes.
